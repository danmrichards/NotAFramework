# Not a Framework

This is not a framework, this is something to get things done in PHP.

This package uses a few community packages to provide just enough functionality to do something useful. For example filp/whoops is used for error handling, symfony/http-foundation is used for HTTP and phroute/phroute for routing (among others).

## Installation

For the moment just clone the repo. Packagist will come soon...or when I get around to it.

## Tests

Yeah...

## License

MIT License yo!
