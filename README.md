# Not a Framework

This is not a framework, this is something to get things done in PHP.

This thing uses a few community packages to provide just enough functionality to do something useful.

For example [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) is used for error handling, [HttpFoundation](symfony/http-foundation) is used for HTTP and [PHRoute](https://github.com/mrjgreen/phroute) for routing. To name but a few.


## Installation

For the moment just clone the repo. Composer will come soon...or when I get around to it.

## Tests

Yeah...

## License
